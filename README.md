Graphs are an interesting data structure for storing data while maintaining relationships 
between the data.  They allow for quick traversing of related items within a graph. This package
was created to improve my own understanding of graphs and graph theory.

## Supported graph representation/s

This currently only supports an Adjacency List, a linked list of related vertices. See
[Graph Representation part 03 - Adjacency List (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1wraWzqtvQ&t=741s&ab_channel=mycodeschool)
to see an explanation of the concept.
